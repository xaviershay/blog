Recently a Nazi was punched mid-interview at an anti-Trump rally. My social group is radically divided on whether this was an acceptable thing to happen. My own thoughts were conflicted and so I wrote this to try and sort it all out.

I have historically been fairly pacifist and in favour of radical free speech. Recently I'm not so committed. This change of heart has been primarily driven by exposure to opinions from people within marginalized groups, and becoming aware of the chilling effect of the open consideration and promotion of ideas fundamentally opposed to their very existence. Free speech has never permitted people to say whatever they want, even in the US.

A younger me may have used a [common framing](http://blogoftheunknownwriter.blogspot.com/2017/01/on-punching-nazis-richard-spencer-saga.html):

> What kind of society are we aiming for here? One where people go around randomly punching people with horrible views?

I no longer believe this framing is valid. It takes a specific act at a specific time and robs it of all context. It is an irrelevant strawman.

Instead consider that the US has a long and still continuing history of [state-violence against black people](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) that recently included the election of a President who is not just [racist](http://fortune.com/2016/06/07/donald-trump-racism-quotes/), but who also provides a [platform](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-keeps-retweeting-white-supremacist-account) for [other prominent racists](http://www.npr.org/2016/08/26/491452721/the-history-of-the-alt-right).

At a rally protesting his election, a [self-identified racist](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/20/richard_spencer_at_the_rnc.html) --- one who has advocated ["peaceful ethnic cleansing"](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/richard-bertrand-spencer-0), whose publications have [literally advocated genocide](https://web.archive.org/web/20120216183528/http:/www.alternativeright.com/main/the-magazine/is-black-genocide-right) --- was developing his platform with mainstream media.

And somebody punched him. That's a far cry from "randomly punching people with horrible views".

But then I'm not the one getting punched. I tried to come up with a similar scenario that had myself or someone like me taking the hit to see if I found a similar analysis convincing. Which is pretty difficult since genocide tends to be in a class of its own.

The closest I came was anti-abortion. There are people who sincerely believe widespread abortion to be the equivalent of mass murder (of babies, no less) and have committed illegal violence because of those beliefs. Is that a legitimate comparision? If yes, do I need to accept punching both of Nazis and anti-abortion activists to be morally consistent?

I don't think so. Regardless of your assessment of the badness of either, they are realised in totally separate ways that deserve distinct moral analysis. On the one hand you have female individuals terminating unborn fetuses within a clinic. On the other, you have state-sponsored violence against an entire population in a public setting. These manifestations shape the forms of resistance that are acceptable or applicable. Even if you come to similar conclusions about which resistance you'll accept in either case, the reasoning must be different.

This is not to say that punching someone here should be legal. It shouldn't. Laws are a peace treaty. They will and need to be broken when that peace is threated, with all the risks that entails. A legal protest is for the most part an oxymoron.

## Utility?

So was this act an effective protest, chilling Spencer and those like him while bringing attention to the Nazis among us and drawing people to the resistance? Or does it undermine its own aims by inviting retaliation and alienating pacifist moderates?

At this point I feel it's largely unknowable, at a least to regular person trying to read the tea leaves of history. There are examples of [both outcomes](https://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/when-are-violent-protests-justified/), reasonable people argue both ways, and in any case there is no counter-factual --- what would have happened if violence had or hadn't been employed?

Different people are going to be drawn to different forms of protest, and they aren't going to agree with each others' methods. At least in this case, diversity of dissent is probably as important as the diversity being protected.

To finish, a person on Twitter, whom I don't know anything about, wrote some [words that seemed reasonable](https://twitter.com/meakoopa/status/823319604386791424). One excerpt:

> You cannot take as given that allowing free and open debate about genocide will stop fascism. Because it never, ever has.
