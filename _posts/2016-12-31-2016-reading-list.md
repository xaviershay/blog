I read fifty-six books this year, [the least of the last five years](2015-reading-list.html). I did watch more films and series though, as well as a couple of video games. I included a bonus section for those. You can find the full list of books over at [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2875383-xavier-shay?utf8=%E2%9C%93&read_at=2016&view=covers&per_page=100). Here are my top picks.

## Non-fiction

#### Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind _by Yuval Noah Harari_

Book of the year. Highly engaging and raises more questions than it answers.
The author seems self-aware of the limitations in knowledge trying to reconstruct
history.

#### Fast Food Nation _by Eric Schlosser_

This book has been on my list for years, and it finally got a guernsey recently when I noticed the author was the same as _Command and Control_, which made my list last year. It's a similar style of book: in-depth but very readable overview of the fast food industry in the US.

#### The Corner _by David Simon_

Before he wrote _The Wire_, Simon spent a year on a Baltimore corner and wrote this book about it. An extraordinary and hard-hitting piece of journalism.

## Skills

#### Getting More _by Stuart Diamond_

I was lucky enough to hear the author talk earlier this year. He was involved in the birth of the Harvard Negotiation Project, back in 1981 when they published [_Getting To Yes_](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0395631246), and has continued in that field ever since. This book covers everything from buying a car to dealing with kids, and includes criticisms and alternatives to strategies from _Getting To Yes_ such as [BATNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement).

#### How Bad Do You Want It _by Matt Fitzgerald_

Second year running this author has made it into my list, after
_Racing Weight_ last year. Excellent look at the psychology of endurance
sports, including much recent research. Still a very early field, since for so
long science focused on purely physical attributes.

## Fiction

#### Where'd You Go Bernadette _by Maria Semple_

Interesting characters and style, good plot that kept me guessing, unconventional pacing, funny, sad.

#### Glow _by Ned Beauman_

I don't know what to say about it so I'll just quote it:

> The sound system isn’t even that loud but the room’s so small that the treble pushes at the sides like a fat toddler stuffed into a car seat.

_Boxer, Beetle_, by the same author, was also quite good.

#### Red Rising Trilogy _by Pierce Brown_

The only trilogy epic I've finished in a long while. Lot of suspense and action, good enough writing to carry it. Hard to put down.

## Bonus: Alternative Media

#### Sicario _by Denis Villeneuve_

A collection of five star set pieces. This film has stuck with me. Director
Denis Villeneuve creates so much tension with so little. The drive into Juarez
and subsequent border crossing scenes are sublime.

#### Firewatch _by Campo Santo_

More of an interactive story than a game, my brother and I played through this
in a single Saturday morning. It made me yearn for the trails, and the voice
acting is spectacular.

#### Ori and the Blind Forest _by Moon Studios_

A perfect platformer. Easily the most visually stunning game I've ever played.
Every scene is gorgeous, the difficultly progression is appropriately
challenging, controls are tight, and the sound track is superb.
