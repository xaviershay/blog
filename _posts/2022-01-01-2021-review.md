More lockdowns, more injuries.

Something about work/CEO.

## Daily Habits

* Read a book (see my [reading list for the year]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/2020-reading-list.html)).
* 60s plank.
* 10 push-ups.
* Anki cards.
* Aural trainer.
* Gratitude journal.

Both plank and push ups fell off the wagon through injuries. Plank is back as
of the last month, push ups not so much.

I've been using [Functional Ear
Trainer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaizen9.fet.android&hl=en_AU&gl=US)
daily all year, starting with the basic training and now on Not-C major
chromatic melodic dictation. Coming off a base of "pretty good at identifying
ascending intervals", my ear has definitely improved. But I've resented the
process (and also plateaued) the past quarter and am looking forward to a
break. I know to improve further I need to work on vocalizing and singing, but
am not motivated to do so.

I'm reviewing my Anki cards daily. The Geography deck I learned last year
provides approximately 3 cards a day. Interestingly, I'm still only sitting at
just about 90% accuracy for mature cards which has been flat all year. This
suggests I've likely found my upper limit using this technique. In the last
month I've added the [NATO phonetic
alphabet](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/766972333) and a well designed deck
for the [periodic table](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/490209917) which
includes visual aids.  The phonetic alphabet is a small deck which I basically
already knew and so was absorped quickly. The elements I'm currently mid-way
through learning.

At the end of the day I write down three things I did well and three things I'm
grateful for. I started this practice in February and have kept at it since. In
addition to the in-the-moment cultivation of gratefulness, it's been nice to
review at the end of the year as well.

A new habit I'm trialing for January is cold showers, or more specifically
"some portion of shower must be cold". Seemed like a fun idea.

Another new habit for this year is "yoga once a week". Running exacerbates a my
general lack of flexibility (something my physio has confirmed multiple times),
and I've wanted to incorporate yoga for a while but never made it fit. My new
gym offers classes and if I can get to one a week that will be good progress.

## Sport

### Hockey

2 games for Open, 1 for Pennant C.

### Climbing

Majority but not all of the green/orange in the gym. Not graded but probably V2/3?

### Running

* Lumberjack 50k
* Bright
* Portland
* Trails in general

Solid year despite some setbacks and not being able to run with other people
for most of it. Logged 2800K all up, an increase of 400K over the past two
years and equal with 2015 for most ever.

![Weekly mileage for the year]({{site.baseurl}}/images/running-2020.png)

Started strong with an accidental [21K PR
(1:25:39)](https://www.strava.com/activities/3123439682) at the Sri Chimnoy
event in February with what was supposed to be a training run. Set out at
marathon pace after an 8K(!) warmup but two laps in was feeling good and
flicked on the afterburners for the final lap.

Kept training strong after that, but burned out at the start of April two weeks
into lockdown. Decided to wrap up the season with a [5K time trial and nabbed another PR
(18:01)](https://www.strava.com/activities/3260978622). Dropped back to about
three runs a week, but none of my long runs hit 20K and I was under 50K a week
for all of the second quarter.

Started pulling out of my slump late June and after four weeks of base building
started Pfitzinger's 16 week marathon plan on July 20. I managed to find a
treadmill despite the shortage and completed most of my training on that, which
was a new experience.

capability has been unexpectedly useful.</em></center>

Was getting to the business end of the plan when I crashed my bike
mid-September, which aside from a couple of test runs took me out completely
for 6 weeks. Sat on around 50-60K for the six weeks after that to get back
into it. Not a lot of workouts but starting to look like I hadn't lost as much
fitness as I feared.

In December I was feeling strong and got around a lot of
trails. Ran a [50K loop around Wilson's Promontory](https://www.strava.com/activities/4440495118) with Dad
which was a highlight for the year. HNTR Tuesday workouts started back
up the next week. Extremely solid [sub-40 Michigan
workout](https://www.strava.com/activities/4513807899) on Christmas day, [30K
in the Macedon Ranges](https://www.strava.com/activities/4522410843) two days
after, then topped off the year with a [Tan PR
(14:40)](https://www.strava.com/activities/4531091278) and a solo loop of the
[Surf Coast 50K route.](https://www.strava.com/activities/4537182665) Extremely
solid month.

Best of all: no overuse injuries! Shoe-wise, have gone through many, many pairs
of Brooks Levitate 2 for normal runs. Now that they are two models out of date
they are quite cheap! Saucony Peregrine 8 for trails, and a pair of Nike
Vaporfly for races and the odd workout. The Peregrine's were my second choice
after not being able to find any Salomon Sense Pro in stock, but they've been
really good --- comfortable, light, zero blisters. In particular have been
surprised at the recovery benefits of the Vaporflys, so am looking to
transition to a similar shoe (maybe the Nike Tempo or Brooks Hyperion Tempo?)
for more of my training, which I expect will continue to help with keeping
injury at bay.

Feeling really good about the year to come!

## Projects

### Music

* Another 7 vlogs continuing to experiment with synthesis, but didn't really follow through on any momentum from last year.
* Three recorded piano pieces. These were the same I was almost ready to record
  at the end of last year, but another injury meant I had to build them back up
  for a third time to record them.

### Programming

* Made a surprisingly popular [tutorial for spaceship automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znPhrcyLXMI) in the Space Exploration mod for Factorio.
* Upgraded my [Vitamin VCV Rack modules](https://github.com/xaviershay/vitamin-vcv-modules) to version 2.
* Made [Peaky Finders](http://peakyfinders.xaviershay.com/), an app to detect and track summits automatically from Strava data.
* A Haskell prototype of a [tool to programatically transform mathematical expressions by applying axioms](https://github.com/xaviershay/haskell-sandbox/blob/master/app/Axiomator.hs#L703).
* A Haskell simulation of a [simplified model of Factorio's circuit network](https://github.com/xaviershay/haskell-sandbox/blob/master/app/Combinators.hs) to help validate some logistics designs.


### Music

* Completed â…” of [Andrew Huang's Music Production
  course](https://monthly.com/andrew-huang-music) --- went back to work and didn't
  have the energy for the final third --- resulting in a completed piece
  [_Renew._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4rZr6Cml0w)
* Published more than [20 vlogs and
  recordings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8-DvIU3okeUS44vrGDNUPg)
  tracking my continued experiments with synthesis, including a few new
  additions on the hardware front. I'm most excited about the Digitone and the
  Peak.
* Wrote up the [voicings I typically use for Chameleon.](https://sheets.xaviershay.com/)
* Did a [comparative analysis of different performances of Chopin's Grand Valse Brillante](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6vqCi178yo).
* Played piano most days when I was able, but not a huge amount of actual
  practice. Had a few new pieces just about ready to record before my accident,
  haven't put the work in to get them back up to scratch yet.

### Games

* **Factorio.** Completed a [marathon deathworld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGrZMtWqntA) (~50h) and the Space Exploration mod.
* **Slay the Spire.** All achievements. Already had about half of them from just general playing last year, biggest part of this was getting to A20 which meant getting a lot better at the game. Enjoyed and played Defect the most.
